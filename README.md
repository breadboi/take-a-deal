# Deal or No Deal Simulator

## Description

This is a personal project that aims to simulate the popular game show "Deal or No Deal." Please note that this simulator is incomplete and does not perfectly replicate the entire gameplay experience of the show.

In this simulator, the user starts by selecting a case, which will be highlighted in green to indicate it as their selected case. Subsequently, the user can continue selecting other cases, which will turn red and reveal their hidden values.

At any point during the game, the user has the option to request a deal from the banker. If the user chooses this option, they will be provided with a deal from the banker. The user then has the choice to either accept the deal or refuse it.

## Gameplay

1. Launch the Deal or No Deal Simulator.

2. You will be presented with a set of numbered cases, each containing a hidden value.

3. Select one case as your chosen case. This case will be highlighted in green to indicate your selection.

4. Start selecting other cases to open. Each time you select a case, it will turn red, revealing its hidden value.

5. After opening a few cases, the banker will offer you a deal.

6. You have the option to either take the deal or refuse it.

7. If you accept the deal, the game ends and the deal value becomes your winnings.

8. If you refuse the deal, the game continues with more cases being opened until the next deal is offered.
